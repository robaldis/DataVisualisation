# DataVisualisation
This was a project to find data to represent using javascript. This was apart of my Programming II modules at university.

My goal for this project was to not only make data visualitations that are useful but also some that get across a message of what that data means, which I feel like isn't always best done with numbers and graphs. This goal lead me to the suicide by method data visualisation that I got inspired from {insert name} I wanted to try my own hand at it even though im not the best at digital drawing.
